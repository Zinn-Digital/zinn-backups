# Zinn® Backups

Back up files and database to your own cloud storage (Google Drive, R2, S3 and more), restore safely, and import backups from other plugins.

Built and maintained by **Neil Lock — CEO, Zinn Digital® Ltd** — https://zinndigital.com

## Download

- **[Download the latest version from zinndigital.com](https://zinndigital.com/wordpress-plugins)** — always current, no account needed.
- Or take the zip from [Releases](../../releases/latest) here on GitHub.

Both are the same file. The download page is the canonical one: it is served from our own infrastructure and is what the plugin's own updater checks against.

## Zinn® Backups Pro

The add-on for Zinn® Backups: several storage destinations at once, scheduled and incremental backups, retention rules, encryption with your own passphrase, deploying a backup to another site with a one-time code, e-mail notices and white label.

Everything in Zinn® Backups keeps working without it.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Version | `1.0.4` |
| Requires WordPress | 6.6 or later |
| Tested up to | WordPress **7.1** |
| Requires PHP | 8.2 or later |
| Licence | GPL-2.0-or-later |

Every release is installed and activated against the current stable WordPress before it is published, on a real install with WooCommerce alongside — the *Tested up to* figure above is that test, not an estimate.

## Install

1. Download the zip.
2. In WordPress: **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**, choose the zip, install.
3. Activate.

On a site we host this plugin keeps itself up to date. On your own WordPress it has no credentials for our update service and does not contact us — check back here, or watch this repository's releases.

## Our other WordPress plugins

- **[zinn-cache](https://github.com/Zinn-Digital/zinn-cache)** — A page cache and a Redis object cache for any WordPress site: the LiteSpeed server cache where there is one and its own disk cache everywhere else, smart auto-purge and a Redis cache that proves it works. Zinn® Cache Pro is an add-on on top of it. · [Install from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zinn-cache/)
- **[zinn-chat](https://github.com/Zinn-Digital/zinn-chat)** — A complete help desk and AI assistant that runs on your own WordPress: answers visitors from your own pages with links using your own AI key, live chat with a multi-chat inbox, and support tickets in wp-admin, on a submit-a-ticket page and in the WooCommerce account area. Under 10 KB on the page, and no requests at all until a visitor opens it.
- **[zinn-connector](https://github.com/Zinn-Digital/zinn-connector)** — Connect any WordPress site to Zinn Digital® so scheduled articles publish to it. Pair with a code from your dashboard. · [Install from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zinn-connector/)
- **[zinn-migrate](https://github.com/Zinn-Digital/zinn-migrate)** — Install it on the WordPress site you are LEAVING. It packages that site — files and database — into one archive and gives you a private link to paste into your Zinn Digital® migration. For hosts that give you no FTP, no SSH and no control-panel API; if you have any of those, Zinn® can fetch the site directly and you do not need this.
- **[zinn-offload](https://github.com/Zinn-Digital/zinn-offload)** — Move a WordPress media library to Zinn® object storage and serve it from a CDN. Configured from the Zinn® dashboard — no access key is ever typed into WordPress. · [Install from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zinn-offload/)
- **[zinn-reseller](https://github.com/Zinn-Digital/zinn-reseller-toolkit)** — Sell Zinn Digital® hosting from your own WordPress site — domain search, one-click client sign-in, and WooCommerce provisioning. · [Install from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zinn-reseller/)
- **[zinn-seo](https://github.com/Zinn-Digital/zinn-seo)** — Complete search engine and AI visibility optimisation for WordPress, built for speed: nothing added to your visitors' pages except the tags search engines read, every setting in one place, a guided setup, SEO roles, settings export and import, and AI agent (MCP) access to every setting.
- **[zinn-translate](https://github.com/Zinn-Digital/zinn-translate)** — Publish a WordPress site in 58 languages on their own web addresses — translated slugs, SEO metadata, menus, WooCommerce and hreflang — translated with a Zinn Digital® plan or the site owner's own provider key. · [Install from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zinn-translate/)

All of them are free to download from https://zinndigital.com/wordpress-plugins.

## Languages

This plugin ships **complete translations for 57 languages** — every label, notice, error and setting it adds to your admin, not a subset. The catalogues are bundled, so they work as soon as you set your site language; there is no separate language pack to install.

5 of them are right-to-left (ar, fa_IR, he_IL, ps, ur) and every screen this plugin adds was rendered in a real WordPress install in each of those languages and checked.

The full list of languages is in `readme.txt` under **Translations**. `languages/` holds the `.pot` template plus a `.po`, `.mo` and `.l10n.php` for every language, so corrections and new languages can be contributed directly.
